TankWarz is a strategic and skill based tank
game that will pit you against other players on
randomly generated terrain. This game will test your
might as a war-machine as well as your war-time
strategy against your opponent. Every bullet is
counted, every shot is timed, you only have one life but you can respawn,
GAME ON!

### How to Play
TankWarz simulates how a tank moves.

- S - move backward in the direction of the tank
- A - turn the tank counterclockwise
- D - turn the tank clockwise
- J - turn the turret counterclockwise
- L - turn the turret clockwise

### Gameplay
Every time you get hit an opponent you get points. If a tank goes down belown 0 HP, the tank is out of the match. However, the player may choose to respawn and play again and their points will be kept. By the end of defined time (default 2 mins) the game ends and the player with most points wins.
